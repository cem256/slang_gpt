# Localizing Flutter Apps with slang and slang_gpt
Translating your app into multiple languages will maximize the number of people who can install, use and recommend it. However, if you are an indie developer or part of a small team with limited resources, hiring translators might not be feasible. Using tools like Google Translate is an option, but they often fail to provide appropriate translations due to their lack of context awareness, leading to inaccurate or awkward results. This is where large language models (LLMs) come into play. LLMs are capable of inferring context and generating human-like text, providing a more natural user experience.
